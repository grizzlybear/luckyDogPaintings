                  <h1> Cost </h1>
                  <p class="priceText"> A dog portrait is currently $400.00.  This is for a hand painted oil or acrylic painting of your dog with a simple complimentary background.  Additions will be added to the price as listed: 
                    </p>
                  <ul class="priceList">
                  
                  <li class="priceText">1) 	Additional dog subjects ($150.00 per each dog added) </li>
                  <li class="priceText">2)	Extra large sizes (over 2’ square) will be charged an additional agreed upon fee for added canvas & shipping charges.</li>
                  <li class="priceText">3)	Specific extraordinary background/layout requests that require additional work will be discussed and priced.</li>
                </ul>
                <h1> Size</h1>
                  <p class="priceText">Without fail, the “model” (dog) and his photo suggest the best size and layout for their portrait.  Some are best on a square canvas and some lend themselves to a rectangular layout. 
                     I prefer to work on larger paintings, but can also complete smaller paintings.  There is much to be said of a portrait that is “larger than life”. </p>
                  <h2>Standard Sizes:</h2>
                  <ul class="priceList">
                    <li class="priceText">16” X 16”</li>
                    <li class="priceText">20" X 20”</li>
                    <li class="priceText">16” X 20”</li>
                  <p class="priceText"> Each painting is individual and sizing will need to be considered when discussing layout. </p>
                  </ul> 
                  <h1> Lead Time</h1>
                   <p class="priceText"> As the paintings are really hand done and only worked on by me, this will vary depending upon my work load when the painting is commissioned.  
                     I will try to accommodate requests when possible, but please try and to allow 3-4 weeks.</p>
                  <h1> Design </h1>
                    <p class="priceText">  I will be happy to work with you in composing a painting that will make you happy.  Photographs are used as the basis of the painting in order to maintain accuracy of unique features and characteristics. However, many elements will be enhanced or minimized in the painting process to provide the most esthetically pleasing portrait.  As an artist, there will be considerations that I will bring to the table, but I will get your approval on the composition prior to actually beginning the painting.
                      </p>
                      <h1> Ordering </h1>
                      <p class="priceText"> I paint using either oils or acrylics.  I will make suggestions based on the dog, or if you have a preference, I will honor it.
                          There are two types of canvases:  the traditional canvas which is 5/8” deep and is usually framed, and a wrapped canvas that is 2” deep.  I usually paint the sides  of the wrapped canvas thereby eliminating the need for a frame.  We will make this decision together.                            
                        </p>
                    <h1>Ordering</h1>
                    <p class="priceText">Contact me at luckydogpaintings@gmail.com , or phone me at (253) 409-5108 to discuss your dog’s portrait.</p>
                    <p class="priceText">I will ask that you furnish me with photos of your pet and ask a few questions about the dog’s personality.  I like to be familiar with the dog I’m painting!</p>
                    <p class="priceText">Once I look over the photos, I will discuss my thoughts for the painting that will show the dog to the best advantage!</p>
                    <p class="priceText">A deposit of $100.00 will be required at this point.  I will then proceed to the best of my ability to paint an accurate, artistic portrayal of your pet.</p>
                    <h1>Payments</h1>
                    <p class="priceText"> Payment may be made by check or Paypal.  As a deposit of $100.00 is due upon ordering, the balance will be due upon delivery of the completed portrait.</p>
                    <h1> Shipping </h1>
                    <p class="priceText">Shipping charges are included in the price, but if painting is being shipped outside of the continental US, charges will be incurred. Shipping is from Renton, Washington.</p>
                    <h1>Framing</h1>
                    <p class="priceText">Price quoted is for unframed art, but as I have a source for reasonably priced  frames, I will be happy to assist in ordering the framing.  Gallery wrapped canvases (2” thick) are typically not framed.
                    </p>
                    <h1>Guarantee</h1>
                    <p class="priceText">All portraits carry a 100% money-back guarantee.  If for any reason you are not totally satisfied with your portrait, I will refund your entire purchase price.  I want you to be happy!
                    </p>
